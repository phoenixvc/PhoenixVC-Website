## Relationships & Next Steps

- **Integration with Deployment**: Some compliance docs may intersect with your deployment folder if you enforce these policies during infrastructure provisioning.
- **Future Documents**: Expand `azure-security-baseline.md` with specifics on NSGs, Key Vault policies, encryption settings, etc.
- **Review Cycle**: Ensure all docs in this folder get quarterly or annual reviews as mandated by your compliance process.
