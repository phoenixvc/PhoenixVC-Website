## Why Use the Phoenix VC Design System? {: #why-use-design-system}
The Phoenix VC Design System is the foundation for consistent, accessible, and scalable user interfaces across our applications. It originated from the need to standardize and streamline design and development workflows. This website is partially built using the design system, showcasing its flexibility and capabilities.

### Key Features of the Design System:
- **Centralized Component Library**: Reusable components for consistent UI/UX.
- **Design Tokens**: Manage colors, typography, and spacing with ease.
- **Accessibility-First Approach**: Built with WCAG compliance in mind.
- **Customizable Themes**: Adaptable to various branding needs.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Intuitive APIs and seamless integration with modern frameworks.
