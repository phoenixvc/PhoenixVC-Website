- @azure Rule - Use Azure Best Practices: When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_best_practices` tool if available.
- @commit Rule - Use Conventional Commits with Emojis: When generating git commit messages, always follow the conventional commit format with appropriate emojis. Format should be: "type(scope): emoji description" where type is feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, or revert. Common emojis: ✨ (feat), 🐛 (fix), 📚 (docs), 💄 (style), ♻️ (refactor), ⚡ (perf), ✅ (test), 🔧 (build/config), 👷 (ci), 🧹 (chore).
